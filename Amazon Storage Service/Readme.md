# AWS Projects Collection

Welcome to my **AWS Projects Collection**! This repository contains a series of practical projects I've worked on using various Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each project demonstrates a different AWS service or solution, showcasing my learning and hands-on experience with cloud computing.

## S3 Storage Service

This project demonstrates the use of **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**. It includes steps for creating an S3 bucket, uploading files, managing bucket permissions, and configuring public access. It is a hands-on example of object storage and how to efficiently manage files, backups, and static website hosting in AWS.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creating an S3 bucket and uploading files
  - Configuring S3 bucket permissions and policies
  - Hosting a static website with S3

Find more details in the [S3 Storage Service folder](s3-storage-service/).

## EFS File System

This project showcases **Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**. It demonstrates how to set up a shared file system between multiple EC2 instances, allowing them to access and modify files concurrently. EFS is ideal for applications that require shared storage or when multiple users or systems need to work on the same files simultaneously.

- **Key Concepts**:
  - Creating an EFS file system
  - Mounting EFS on EC2 instances
  - Configuring security groups and file access

Find more details in the [EFS File System folder](efs-file-system/).

## Other AWS Services Projects

In addition to S3 and EFS, this repository will eventually contain more projects covering additional AWS services. These will include services such as **EC2**, **Lambda**, **DynamoDB**, **CloudFormation**, and more.

Stay tuned for more projects coming soon!
